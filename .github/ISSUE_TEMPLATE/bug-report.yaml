        - On Mac or linux, you need to run Blender from a terminal, where you can later see the debug info.
        - On Windows, you need to toggle system console in the top menu (see screenshot below).

        Please provide information about Blender and BlenderKit versions, operating system etc.
        
        Through command line: you can get the version info by running following command in command line (on Windows use `blender.exe` instead of `blender`):
        `blender -b --python-expr "import bpy;import blenderkit;print('\n\n>>> VERSION INFO, please copy to bug report:\n\nBlenderKit version:',blenderkit.bl_info['version'],'\nBlender version:',bpy.app.version_string, bpy.app.build_date, bpy.app.build_platform,'\n\n<<<')"`

        Through GUI:
        BlenderKit version: in Blender click on: `EDIT -> Preferences -> Addons`, search for BlenderKit and expand it, which will show you the version of addon.
        Blender version: in Blender click on: `Blender Icon (left from FILE) -> About Blender` which will show you the version of Blender.
