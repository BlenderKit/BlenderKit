    1. Script is not recognized as module which would break at relative import. We need to set __package__ = "blenderkit" for legacy addon.
    Or __package__ = "bl_ext.user_default.blenderkit"/"bl_ext.blenderkit_com.blenderkit_com". Otherwise we would see:
       from . import paths
       ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
    2. External repository (e.g. blenderkit_com) is not available as we start with --factory-startup, we need to enable it.
    We can add it as LOCAL repo as the add-on is installed and we do not care about updates or anything in this BG script. Otherwise we would see:
