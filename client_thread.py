"""Background communication thread for the BlenderKit-Client.

The legacy code path makes every HTTP roundtrip to the local Go client on
Blender's main thread. Even on 127.0.0.1 these calls can block long enough to
stutter the UI when the client is busy. This module moves report polling and
explicitly opted-in fire-and-forget requests onto a daemon worker thread.

The module is opt-in: it is only activated when both ``experimental_features``
and ``thread_communication`` preferences are True. When disabled the worker is
stopped and timer.py falls back to the original synchronous path.

Threading rules:
    * The worker thread MUST NOT touch ``bpy.*`` or any Blender data.
    * The main thread is the only writer of the request state snapshot; the
      worker only reads it.
    * Tasks parsed from reports are still dispatched (``handle_task``) on the
      main thread. The worker just shuttles bytes over the wire.
